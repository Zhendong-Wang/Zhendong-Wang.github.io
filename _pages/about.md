I am a first year PhD student in the department of Statistics & Data Science of the University of Texas, Austin. Before coming to UT, I completed my Master degree at Columbia University, majoring in Data Science. I received my Bachelor degree in Civil Engineering from Tongji University in China, during which I went to the University of California, Berkeley for one year exchange study. 

Currently, I am supervised by professor Mingyuan Zhou, at the University of Texas, Austin, and we focused a lot on Bayesian deep learning, and reinforcement learning. 

In the first project, we used reinforcement learning to refine categorical sequence generation models. However, high gradient variance hinders the practical use of this method. To stabilize this method for contextual generation of categorical sequences, we estimated the gradient by evaluating a set of correlated Monte Carlo rollouts. Our proposed models yield lower gradient variance and consistent improvement over related baselines. This paper is accepted by ICLR 2020.

In the second project, we proposed a new probabilistic modeling framework for Thompson sampling (TS). Most of the recent methods rely on using global variable uncertainty to do exploration in TS, which will suffer from high computation cost. However, we started from a distinct point, using local variable uncertainty with semi-implicit structure to do posterior approximation. Our experiment shows TS guided by local uncertainty achieves the state-of-the-art performance while having low computational complexity. This paper is accepted by ICML 2020.

Currently, I am still doing research on introducing uncertainty into policy gradient method of reinforcement learning, in order to help models achieve better exploration and converge to better local optimal.

I have a good background in Statistics and Computer science, and my research interests include the following areas:

- Bayesian Deep Learning
- Reinforcement Learning
