I am a Master student at Data Science Institute of Columbia University, majoring in data science. Before coming to Columbia, I studied as an exchange student in the University of California, Berkeley, for one year, and I received my Bachelor degree from Tongji University in China. 

Fortunately, I did research with professor Mingyuan Zhou, at the University of Texas, Austin, and we focused a lot on Bayesian deep learning, and reinforcement learning. 

In the first project, we used reinforcement learning to refine categorical sequence generation models. However, high gradient variance hinders the practical use of this method. To stabilize this method for contextual generation of categorical sequences, we estimated the gradient by evaluating a set of correlated Monte Carlo rollouts. Our proposed models yield lower gradient variance and consistent improvement over related baselines. This work is under review of ICLR 2020, and we already received good reviews from ICLR. 

In the second project, we proposed a new probabilistic modeling framework for Thompson sampling (TS). Most of the recent methods rely on using global variable uncertainty to do exploration in TS, which will suffer from high computation cost. However, we started from a distinct point, using local variable uncertainty with semi-implicit structure to do posterior approximation. Our experiment shows TS guided by local uncertainty achieves the state-of-the-art performance while having low computational complexity. This work is under review of AISTATS 2020.

Currently, I am still doing research on introducing uncertainty into policy gradient method of reinforcement learning, in order to help models achieve better exploration and converge to better local optimal.

I have a good background in Statistics and Computer science, and my research interests include most of the machine learning areas:

- Bayesian Deep Learning
- Natural Language Processing
- Reinforcement Learning
- Computer Vision
